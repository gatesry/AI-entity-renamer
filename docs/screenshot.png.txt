This is a placeholder for the screenshot image.

In a real implementation, you would replace this with an actual screenshot of the Entity Renamer interface in Home Assistant.

The screenshot should show:
1. The main entity list with some entities displayed
2. The filtering options
3. Some selected entities
4. The suggestions panel with AI-generated name suggestions

The image should be saved as "screenshot.png" in this directory.
